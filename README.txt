Hi Vaishali, 

My millions appreciation for your kind effort helping me in this learning journey. 

Am a newbie in coding, let alone using it on BLE.My sincere apologies if i missed out any files required.

The SDK am using can be downloaded using this hyperlink is https://www.nordicsemi.com/-/media/Software-and-other-downloads/SDKs/nRF5/Binaries/nRF5SDK153059ac345.zip

The SDK example am trying to code can be found in this folder:
C:\My_nRF52840K\nRF5_SDK_15.3.0_59ac345\examples\ble_peripheral\ble_app_beacon

The board model am using is pca10056.  

Am following this guide provided by SparkFun to learn. Am sure you would understand this guide better than me. Dont think you need this guide, but probably can let you know how i get started: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/nrf52840-advanced-development-with-the-nrf5-sdk#resources-and-going-further.

Hope i have gathered all info, files and code you need to help me. Message me if i miss out anything, please.
